# Movie Database Project

- Summary
We want to create a way for users to easily search through movies and get information about them. The frontend, at a minimum, would have ways for users to search for movies and sort them by relevant characteristics like title, rating, etc. We could also expand on the project to add things like being able to see how actors are related to each other through the movies they co-star and build a graph of that. Another possible way to expand the project would be to have a database of ratings that users could add to.

- External API
We plan to use the API https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started (or similar) to get data about the movies. The database provides a lot of unique ways to get movie information and possible avenues of exploration like getting ratings, pictures, and lists of actors.
